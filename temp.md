❌ Bad Code:
```javascript
function add(){return a+b}
```

🔍 Issues:
* ❌ The function `add` does not declare or define its parameters `a` and `b`. This will lead to unexpected behavior as
it relies on variables in the outer scope (which might not exist or have the intended values).
* ❌ Missing JSDoc documentation.

✅ Recommended Fix:

```javascript
/**
* Adds two numbers together.
*
* @param {number} a The first number.
* @param {number} b The second number.
* @returns {number} The sum of a and b.
*/
function add(a, b) {
return a + b;
}
```

💡 Improvements:
* ✔ Declares the parameters `a` and `b` within the function signature, making it clear what inputs the function expects.
* ✔ Adds JSDoc documentation, explaining the purpose of the function, its parameters, and the return value. Good
documentation is crucial for maintainability and understanding.
